# Cold Phone Script: Website Offer

Prep
- Research: [Business Name], services, current site/Google listing.
- Goal: book a 10–15 min demo or free audit.
- Tools ready: calendar link, email template, audit checklist.

Opener
- “Hi, is this [Owner/Manager Name]? This is [Your Name] from [Your Company]. We build fast, mobile-first websites for local businesses. Did I catch you with 60 seconds?”
    - If no: “No problem—when’s a better time today or tomorrow?”
    - If yes: proceed.

Qualify (pick 2–3)
- “Are you happy with your current website and the leads it brings?”
- “How do new customers usually find you?”
- “Is your site easy to update on your end?”

Value Brief
- “We help local businesses:
    - Load 2–3x faster on mobile and rank better on Google.
    - Convert more calls/forms with clearer offers and CTAs.
    - Add online booking, chat, and review widgets.
    - Keep content fresh with an easy editor.”

Offer
- “I can run a free 10-minute audit of [their site or listing] and show quick wins. If it makes sense, we can share a simple homepage mockup. Would [Day/Time] work for a short screen-share?”

If No/Objections
- Too busy: “Understood. I’ll send a one-page audit you can skim in 2 minutes. What’s the best email? I’ll also hold [Day/Time] and you can confirm if it still works.”
- Already have a site: “Great—most of our clients did. We typically keep your brand and improve speed, SEO, and conversions. Want a free benchmark so you can compare?”
- No budget: “Totally get it. We offer phased plans and results-first milestones. If the audit doesn’t show clear ROI, we’ll part as friends.”
- Send info: “Happy to. What would be most useful: speed/SEO report, design mock, or pricing? I’ll include a 10-min slot—feel free to accept or suggest another time.”

Close
- “Let’s lock [Day/Time]. I’ll send a calendar invite to [Email] with a Zoom link and the audit. Sound good?”
- “If anything changes, just reply ‘reschedule’ and we’ll move it.”

Voicemail (if no answer)
- “Hi [Name], it’s [Your Name] at [Company]. We help [Business Type] get more local leads with faster, mobile-first sites. I ran a quick audit for [Business Name]—happy to share. Call/text [Phone] or use [Short URL] to pick a 10-min slot.”
